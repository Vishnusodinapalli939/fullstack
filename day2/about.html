            Fresh, quality produce is the backbone of every restaurant. Easy access can improve the quality of food, reduce waste and save costs.<br> With the easy availability of new and old technology, thereâ€™s barely any reason for commercial kitchens to not have even a small vegetable or herb patch.
    
    <b>COSTS</b>
    
    Farm-to-table food has been a buzzword in the culinary world. Gourmets place emphasis on hyperlocal cuisine, organic produce, and fresh flavours. <br>Sourcing this from supermarkets or vendors can increase costs as herbs and vegetables tend to have a short shelf life. After factoring in expenses on <br>garden infrastructure, soil, seeds, and upkeep, growing produce in a restaurant kitchen garden can save thousands in produce bills, refrigeration costs, and waste.
    
    <b>QUALITY</b>
    
    Growing your own produce can keep you in better control of the quality of the ingredients. You can source organic seeds, ensure the fertiliser is <br>chemical-free, and work towards water efficiency. Vegetables, herbs and fungi from your garden will help set and maintain a standard of quality. With barely<br> a few hours between harvest and consumption, you can genuinely promise the freshest ingredients.
